                Saftey is extremely important when it comes to camping because the you may be far from the nearest
                main  road so help is far away and you may not have cell service to call for help so you need to know what to do when you get hurt and cant just call an ambulance
                but the best way to help with saftey is to not get hurt in the first place.
                You always want to have a first aid kit when you go camping you can buy one at walmart or other retail stores.
                In the event somone does get hurt the first thing to do is not panick and use the first aid the best way possible then get help 
                either from the main office near your camp ground or going to the hospital if it is needed.
                Dont mess with things your not supposed to and stay on the trail if you are hicking near your camp site.
