                Georgia is a gold mine when it comes to camping there are so many good locations
                its hard to find a bad location so ill just name a few, number one is High Falls State Park
                whether its the hiking to see the falls or the great campsites it hard to find something not great with this location.

                Number two is Stone Mountain Park Campground for the great scenery and cheep entry fee.
                <hr>
                number three is Fort Yargo State Park for the beautiful lakes and many things to do there with frends and family.
