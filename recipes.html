                The best part about camping in my opinion is the food whether its just hamburgers or sliver turtles.
                the first dish that i reccomend when you are camping is going to be a breakfast dish and the dish is steak and eggs
                which is very simple and easy for when you wake up from a long day of activites. I reccomend checking out this

                After a good morning and its finaly time for some more good food Brats are a staple for camping 
                for how easy they are and how delicious they are for a great recipe click <a href="https://www.freshoffthegrid.com/cast-iron-brats-peppers-onions/">here</a>

                Now for the best time of the tripe diner time where you can relax under the stars and eat a good meal for diner 
                I recommend sliver turtles now yopur not actualy eating a turle its just looks like one when its on the fire
                and another reason i like them so much is they are so versatile so the website I reccomend has more then one way to pepare them
