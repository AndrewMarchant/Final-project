        I am apart of a non profit company and I just want to help people on their endeavors.
        I am just one person that has created this website so bare with me if theres any mistakes.
        Ever since i was young i had a passion for camping and now that im older i want people to enjoy it
        as well thats one of the main reasons i decided to make this website for everyone to enjoy.

        This website will be covering the basics of camping and dabbling in each subject of it like safty and 
        clean up,cooking,best places, and how much you should be prepared to spend on everything. 
        The first time i went camping and what striked a fire under me with camping was in about 2009
        when me and my family went camping because my brother was a Boy scout. that night that we were in
        the tents was a magical one the sleeping bag was not to cold or too warm the air was not too crisp it 
        was perfect.
